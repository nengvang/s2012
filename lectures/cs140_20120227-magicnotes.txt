1. Pick how many potions will be made (from 1 to 5)
    num_potions = random.randint(1, 5)
2. Locate each potion (saving state)
    potions = []
    for potion in range(num_potions):
        # Randomly generate x,y for a potion
        x = random.randint(1, 15)
        y = random.randint(1, 15)
        potions += [[x, y]]

3. Draw board
    To locate a potion, replace specific check with general
    elif [inner, outer] in potions:
        print 'P',
