# Consider a triangle with sides of length 3, 7, and 9. The Law of Cosines
# states that given three sides of a triangle (a, b, and c) and the
# angle C between sides a and b: c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab cos(C).

# Part 1: Write Python code to calculate the three angles of the triangle.

# Part 2: Write an interactive program that asks the user for the lengths of
# three sides of a triangle, and the measure of the angle between sides a
# and b. Then calculate the three angles, and display the results.
